🛠️ Development Journey (Storytelling)
I started this project after realizing how much my grandparents struggled with smartphones—complicated menus, tiny fonts, and no one to ask for help.
I sketched out an ultra-simple interface and built the first MVP using:

React + Firebase for data management.

Gemini API for a conversational AI assistant.

A daily mission and leveling system to keep learning engaging.

During early user testing, seniors shared positive feedback:

“Thanks to the levels and tasks, I actually want to use my phone every day.”
